# DSA

This is a tool to help me solve/test the problems found within the book "Data
Structures And Algorithms in JavaScript - Optimizing Performance and Solving
Programming Challenges" by Federico Kereki.

## Plan

- Use Jest to create tests for each problem
- Write a script to clear the answers but keep the formatted code
- Take notes as I go through the book

## Notes

### Part 1

- [Using JavaScript](./notes/part1/using_javascript.md)
- [Functional Programming](./notes/part1/functional_programming.md)

### Part 2

- [Designing Algorithms](./notes/part2/sorting.md)
