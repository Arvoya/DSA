# DSA

This is a tool to help me solve/test the problems found within the book "Data
Structures And Algorithms in Javascript - Optimizing Performance and Solving
Programming Challenges" by Federico Kereki.

## Plan

- Use Jest to create tests for each problem
- Write a script to clear the answers but keep the formatted code
- Take notes as I go through the book

## Index

### Part 1

- [Using Javascript](./notes/part1/using_javascript.md)
